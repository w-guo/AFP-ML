# Automated Tow End Inspection

This repository contains the code for the Boeing project [Deep learning for automated in-process inspection of composite layup](https://depts.washington.edu/barc/projects/data-science-manufacturing). The goal of this project is to improve the accuracy of tow end identification to reduce as much of the time-consuming manual inspections as possible. More details can be found on the [project website](https://wguo.rbind.io/post/boeing-afp/).
